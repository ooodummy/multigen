# MultiGen

Multiplatform SDK generator for game hacking.
This project is being done as a learning experience and because I want to make a better version of our preexisting
tooling (UnispectEx).  
Random contributions are welcome.

## Backend Environments

- [ ] [IL2CPP](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/IL2CPP.html)
- [ ] [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/)
- [ ] [Unreal Engine 5](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/unreal-engine-5)
- [ ] [Source 2](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_2)

## Extra Features

- [ ] PDB parser
  - Automatically detect symbol servers and download corresponding PDB files [example](https://github.com/SamuelTulach/ida-unity-pdb-downloader)
- [ ] Dependency tree resolver
- [ ] Engine encryption (ex. Rainbow Six Siege)
  - I don't know how this can automatically be handled we would need to disassemble the game automatically
- [ ] ImGui interface
